# Eyes RL: Learning to Recognize Digits with a Focus-Based Approach

**Description:**

Eyes RL introduces a novel reinforcement learning approach to image recognition inspired by human vision. By mimicking the way our eyes selectively focus on areas of interest, this project demonstrates accurate digit recognition using a limited 4x4 input window, challenging the traditional reliance on large inputs and convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

**Key Features:**

* **Focus-Based Learning:** Simulates human-like vision by using a small, moving window to analyze images.
* **Reinforcement Learning Agent:** An LSTM-based agent learns optimal movement and zoom actions to maximize recognition accuracy.
* **Efficient Architecture:** Achieves competitive performance without the use of CNNs.
* **MNIST Benchmark:** Demonstrates the effectiveness of Eyes RL on the MNIST dataset, achieving a 69% accuracy with only a 4x4 input.
